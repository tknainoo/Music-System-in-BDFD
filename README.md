## Features added in the previous version

* Reduced as many errors as possible that prevented adding music
* Fixed errors for **NON-PREMIUM bots**
* Added **AI system** (this system gives recommendations and automatically adds them to the playlist)
* Changed the search library for better readability and to avoid most possible errors
* Added button coloring and action names
* Added **download system** to download the currently playing music from the playlist (only for 1 minute, after that it can’t be downloaded)



## Features added in the new version v6.0

* \:outbox\_tray: **Send Current Audio**
  └ Sends the current song file to any text channel

* ⏭️ **Jump to Song**
  └ Skip directly to any song in the list by its position

* \:arrows\_counterclockwise: **Crossfade**
  └ Smooth transitions between songs

* \:zap: **Speed Control**
  └ Change playback speed (0.25x up to 2.0x)

* \:microphone: **Karaoke Mode**
  └ Lowers vocals so you can sing your favorite songs



## Possible Bugs

The system is fully functional, but it still has some bugs that will be fixed over time.
Some possible bugs are:

* Music not being added to the playlist (rarely, and mostly due to video permissions).



## Bot Panel

Do you want me to also **simplify** this into a shorter **README.md in English** (like for GitHub), or keep it detailed?
